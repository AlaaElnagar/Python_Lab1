Task 1:
arguments=['1.92', '0.36', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'base_link', 'lidar_link'],
Comment : 0.36 should be in z direction

arguments=['1.8', '-.03', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'base_link', 'zed_link'],
Comment : Zed_link has value in z direction

arguments=['1.8', '-0.50', '1', '1.57', '0', '0', 'base_link', 'imu_link'],
Comment:
imu_link is  90 degree clockwise of base_footprint.
clockwise means negative degree
counter clockwise means positive degree

Comment: Please always make sure to read the question properly and stick to the names: (base_footprint , carkyo_static_tf_launch.py and so..)


Task 2:
Great work. But the lidar goes only on one direction (down) .. It should go on both directions.
Again: I expected the frame names to be "lidar_link" and "servo_link" as shown in lab slides, Also the python file name: brodcast_lidar_transform.py
